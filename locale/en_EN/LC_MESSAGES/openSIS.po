Then, it divides that value by the number you specified as the base for your weighted scale.  For unweighted GPA, the Calculate GPA program simply takes the GPA value of the grade the student earned.  After finding the GPA points earned for each course, the program averages these values to determine the students to-date GPA.  It then sorts these values to determine the class rank.  If more than one student has the same GPA, they will share a position in class rank."
